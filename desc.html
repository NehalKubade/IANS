        <h1>Modified Caesar Cipher</h1>
        <p>
          The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest
          methods of encryption technique. It’s simply a type of substitution
          cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with
          a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a
          shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The
          method is apparently named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it
          to communicate with his officials. Thus to cipher a given text we need
          an integer value, known as a shift which indicates the number of
          positions each letter of the text has been moved down.
          <br /><br />
          Procedure: <br /><br />
          Traverse the given text one character at a time . For each character,
          transform the given character as per the rule, depending on whether
          we’re encrypting or decrypting the text. Return the new string
          generated.

          Algorithm for Modified Caesar Cipher: <br /><br />
          Input: A String of lower case letters, called Text. An Integer between
          0-25 denoting the required shift.
          <br />
          <br />
          E_n(x)=(x+n)mod\ 26 (Encryption Phase with shift n)<br><br> D_n(x)=(x-n)mod\
          26 (Decryption Phase with shift n)
